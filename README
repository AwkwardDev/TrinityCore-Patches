These are patches for various features/modifications that can be applied against TrinityCore.

Most were requested by specific individuals and were simply something fun for me to do or
a proof of concept. Please don't be surprised if they do not meet the highest of standards!

I have tested each of these for myself, but make no guarantee of their working for you.

All patches are applied against your TrinityCore/src/* path.
Apply patches with 'patch -p0 -i <patch>'
