PURPOSE
  Adds a custom holiday to the game to be used for granting +50% Xp server-wide on
  every Saturday and Sunday.

STATUS
  Working as of: https://github.com/TrinityCore/TrinityCore/commit/5365bd25fae59a6ae225534b779bd6c14779599a

DETAILS
  This patch will add HOLIDAY_CUSTOM_01 to an un-used Holidays.dbc slot number. This was
  a quick hack and does not currently update client calendars to show the holiday in effect.
  By default the holiday is active every Saturday and Sunday starting 2001-02-11 and all
  characters will gain 50% more experience while the holiday is active.

INSTALL
  01 : Apply custom_holiday.patch to TrinityCore folder.
  02 : Import custom_holiday.world.sql to TrinityCore `world` database.
  03 : Recompile source and enjoy.
